## Description
Just Another Text Editor (or JATE) is an application that displays text and allows you to edit it. You can use it to have a template before you edit a more sensitive file, or for other more fun things. It is avalible offline, and installable. It was made using mainly web-pack, JavaScript, and other npm packages. It was made as a way for me to gain experience working with and creating PWAs (progressive web applications) and to give people a space to be experimental with text

Thank you to the staff at UNCC for providing me with starter code to make programming this application easier

Thank you to Dan Mueller for providing me with the code used in src-sw.js under the client folder, see the comment at the top of that file for concerns.

Lastly thank you to my peers and the staff at UNCC, without you my coding journey would be a lot harder.
